//IDEA: Kaladin Fees:
    //Constants: 
        //totalFee: x
        //Kaladin percentage: y
        //routeFee: x - (x * y)
        //Kaladin Fee: x * y. (i.e. Kaladin fee is a percentage of route fee.)
    //we have two fields, ownerTotalSent, partnerTotalSent, for each one of the tokens. These are only used during a settle call, or during a 
    //startDispute call. We could monkey around with where we want to pass them, just check that they are double signed. 
    //For the partnerTotalSent in each token, they are paying fees on this. So their token total is total - (total * totalFee). We then increment ownerTotal by total * routeFee.
    //For the ownerTotalSent, these fees are being paid to the partner, so we increment partnerFunds by routeFee and decrement ownerFunds by totalFee.
    //NOTE that an extra KaladinFee * (ownerTotalSent * partnerTotalSent) remains in the contract, but wont get added to owner funds.
    //Thus, when the owner goes to withdraw all of their funds at the very end, they can't withdraw all of the funds. The remaining funds are able to be claimed by Kaladin. We skim the difference!
    //This method saves us the need to set even more state variables after a swap completes.

    //These are just the fees... we also need to worry about KALADIMES!
        //For this, their amounts Kaladimes will be some function of the amount of ownerTotalSent, partnerTotalSent, where you receives more Kaladimes the more you send,
        //and contract owners are rewarded with significantly higher amounts.

    //Fees are checked in settle, settleSubset, in withdraw (after a dispute).

    //TODO: 
        //Call out to UNISWAP, add redemption for Kaladin, redemption for owner, contract factory => approve Kaladimes at init.

    //Additions needed:
        //Kaladin can only withdraw if lockCount == 0. we need that if owner withdraws, Kaladin can withdraw(to prevent owner keeping a single inconsequential swap open, stopping Kaladin from ever collecting fees)
            //but Kaladin can only withdraw if lockCount == 0 and owner has already withdraw, since Kaladin skimming differences.
            //TODO: make this better. One idea is to allow Kaladin to withdraw provided that they supply an array of [channelID, balanceTotalsHash]. For every one of these, they need to 
                //match with an current channelID, and the len(array) == lockCount. For each one, we add their totals to the tokenAmounts. Then after this, we can withdraw the difference between the tokenAmounts and the total in the contract
                //The difficulty here is that this requires the channels to not change rapidly, for our array will likely be out of dateâ€” for this, sean can stop allowing route calls for a bit before trying to take funds, which will help our chances
                //(we can do nothing about, increaseChannelFunds, settle, settleSubset calls). This will also be relatively expensive, so probably only makes sense to do this for high traffic contracts.
        //Function Kaladin can hit (with a signature?) to get paid.
        //Way for owner to withdraw without self destruct AND self destruct not possible till Kaladin withdraw. Or, self destruct also pays out to Kaladin. 

    //Special Notes:
        //The fee, given by fees / FEE_DENOM, are always truncated to the nearest integer.
        //If the fees are greater than the totals in the channel, then the amount for the channel is completely drained, even though this is less than the fees owed.
            // It is up to nodes to make sure this doesnt happen before signing messages.
        //If a shard reverts, the fees field isn't updated. However, if it succeeds: and ownerGiving, owner fees incremented; else, partner fees incremented.
    //Tricky Bits:
        //When figuring out how to pay Kaladimes, how do we know the conversion rate between a random IERC20 and a Kaladime? A: call out to Uniswap contract to get the conversion rate?
            //Are Kaladimes pegged to a value? Free floating? WOuld this value be a stablecoin or a fluctuating currency like ETHER?
        //How do we approve to the contract Kaladimes, so they can transferFrom and transfer and arbitrary amount.



    //Projected Fees for n tokens:
        //21k: for a call to chain
        //??: on chain logic
        //7300 * n: for call to partnerIERC20 transfers
        //5000 * n: for setting contract state variable balances
        //17300: 12300 for changing transferFrom(contract, partnerAddr)on Kaladime contract + 5000k for changing Kaladime state variable balance for owner
        //2500 * n: calls out to the Uniswap "price feeds"
        //Total: 38300 + ?? + 14800 * n.  



//TODO: get paying with one address (on enter, exit) but actually signing msgs with a separate one, so that a user
    //can use wallet to sign etner, get funds in wallet at exit, but wont have ot touch wallet for all of sigs. WIll just be touching the chromelocalstorage key for msg signing

//TO DO: make sure that the nonces of all the msg types are incremented appropriately (in here and protocol wise) so that there are no bugs with a potential > vs >=, etc.
//TO DO: determine if we want some notion of slashing for getting trumped. Would need a clause that only allows slash if trump 2+ higher. Can't do 1 higher, bc this happens when waiting in aRc or cLa if party goes unresponsive.
    //Im thinking not? And we reserve the slashing primarily for the shards? Just too hard for txs, bc we are trusting watchtowers with signed txs, and we need to give these to them to preserve liveness, so nothing to stop them from pubbing old txs, and causing a slashing.
    //Only real way I see us having slashing is if we incorporate CCs like BTC, and only send watchtowers CCs, not txs. Messy though, doesnt really seem worth it. 

    //Another slashing related idea is that maybe if a owner, partner submits startDispute, and then gets trumped, they get fully slashed. Something to do with watchtowers submitting startDispute and staking KLD, if they are trumped,
    //KLD slashed, but if they aren't trumped, their KLD doubles. IDK. Need to make sure that owner, partner can't collude, not send most recent txs, in order to intentionally slash a watchtower/hold their KLD ransom. 
     

//TO DO: include logic so that if an anchor call fails due to insufficient owner funds, then owner transfers funds to CP, 
    //to pay for the gas costs. Will require the use of an additional data structure so no replay repay gas attack possible.
    

//TO DO: change contract so that construct supports initializing with array of tokens, funds (in other words, calls out to addFundsToContract). 
    //DOUBLE TO DO: dont think this is possible due to IERC20's needing the contract address to be set for approve call, but can't be done until contract initialized
//TO DO: decide whether safer to have disputeBlockTimeout, shardBlockTimeouts be set on time, or on blocks.


//TO DO: remove any unnecessary intermediate variables to optimize gas.
//TO DO: make sure I dont declare a channel, but then use channels[channelID] unnecessarily later in the same fn. 

//TO DO: if makes a difference gas wise, cram all same slot storage variables in at once, rather than 1 at a time. 

//TODO: do we want to strip out disputeBlockTimeout altogether and enfore it to be say, 2 hours, or 1 hour, or 30 mins, or a contract constant that is blockcahin dependent.

//         This is the timeout, a constant in the channel, that last from when startDispute is called, in blocks. 
//         Other parties can trump this message as long as it falls within disputeBlockTimeout. 
//         Note that even after disputeBlockTimeout has ended, parties can still change shardBlockTimeouts. Also, a withdraw call cant succed until after this timeout has ended, to allow counterparty time to trump.

//         this is the nonce for the channel, which is incremented for every new channel that is entered into in the contract. 
//         This is to prevent against a replay attack by someone who has restaked into the contract with the same tokens,
//         otherTokens, and also the same address. Also, this needs to be kept track of in an off chain DB, for if this were an on chain variable, it would a). be more expensive. 
//         b). could allow a party to resubmit an anchor multiple times, as the anchor would get the contractNonce added on chain, have a differnet channelID,

Second t = 1, Alice sig + secretForwardBob. Third t = 2, Bob sig. NOTE: Alice ScriptPK in this txdelay is a standard lightning ScriptPK: Bob redeem instant w cc, Alice redeem at timeout t. 
                                    //Now, the timeouts functions so that Bob will have enough time to figure out fwd or rvrt with upstream. Then, he SHOULD publish txR, txF. This is all before tx1d becomes valid. Now, with at least 1 hr left on eth,
